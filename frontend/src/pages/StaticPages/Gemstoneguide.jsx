					How to Select the Right Gemstone
				</h2>
				<p className="text-[#626262] text-[16px] sm:text-[18px] leading-relaxed mb-6">
					For centuries, gemstones have been cherished for both their
					astrological significance and their beauty in jewelry. When choosing a
					gemstone for jewelry, factors like appearance and durability are key.
					However, selecting an astrological gemstone is a more intricate
					process that requires detailed astrological calculations and horoscope
					analysis by a qualified astrologer.
				</p>
				<p className="text-[#626262] text-[16px] sm:text-[18px] leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Since astrological gemstones can impact your career, finances, and
					personal life, we highly recommend consulting a certified astrologer
					before making your choice.

					Ensuring Authenticity & Quality
				</h2>
				<p className="text-[#626262] text-[16px] sm:text-[18px] leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Gemstones are cherished not only for their beauty but also for their
					astrological and healing properties. Ensuring the quality and
					authenticity of a gemstone is essential to avoid disappointment.
					Unfortunately, some dealers use deceptive tactics to sell treated or
					fake stones. Always purchase gemstones from a reputable source that
					provides transparency and certification.
				</p>
				<p className="text-[#626262] text-[16px] sm:text-[18px] leading-relaxed mb-6">
					Investing in a lab-certified gemstone or hallmarked jewelry ensures
					the best value. For rare or high-value gemstones, rely on
					certifications from trusted labs like <strong>IGI, GTL, GIA,</strong>{" "}
					or <strong>GRS</strong>.
				</p>
				<p className="text-[#626262] text-[16px] sm:text-[18px] leading-relaxed mb-6">
					At <strong>Gemrishi</strong>, we prioritize authenticity and quality
					above all. While competitors may offer lower prices, they often cannot
					match our standards. Every gemstone and piece of gemstone jewelry we
					provide is 100% natural and genuine.
